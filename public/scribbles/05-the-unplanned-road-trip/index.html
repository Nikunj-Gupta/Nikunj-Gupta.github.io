We started talking. Really talking. Not the surface-level stuff, but the deep, meaningful conversations that only seem to happen at 2 AM when you’re miles away from home. We laughed until our sides hurt, shared secrets we’d never told anyone, and sang our hearts out to the worst songs ever recorded.\nSomewhere along the way, we learned that the destination isn’t the point. It’s the journey, the detours, the unplanned moments that make it all worthwhile. Life is like that, isn’t it? You can plan every detail, but it’s the unexpected twists that define you, that teach you who you really are.\nSo here’s to unplanned road trips, to the chaos, the laughter, the wrong turns that lead to the right places.
