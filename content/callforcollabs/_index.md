## Call for Collaborations! 

If you would like to collaborate with me and my research lab, please feel free to hit me up! If you are at USC, we can meet in person too. I am on campus almost any time, any day! 

I enjoy working on almost any project that involves reinforcement learning, with a special interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning. I am also open to more general research ideas in deep learning and artificial intelligence. 

If you have an idea of what you want to work on, great! If not, I would be happy to discuss/spawn some ideas that we can work on! :)
