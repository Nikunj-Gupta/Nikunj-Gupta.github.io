## Call for Collaborations! 

If you would like to collaborate with me and my research lab, please hit me up! If you are at USC, we can meet in person too. I am on campus almost any time, any day! 

I enjoy working on almost any project that involves reinforcement learning, with a special interest in multi-agent systems. I am also open to more general research ideas in deep learning and artificial intelligence.
