It's all about focus, determination, and grit. 

No room for vulnerability or imperfection? It's like you're expected to be this relentless force, always charging forward, never showing weakness. But the truth is, we're all human. We have our bad days, moments of doubt, and times when we just need to take a step back. 

Easy to forget about self-care? You neglect your physical and mental well-being because you're so focused on chasing after your goals. But eventually, that kind of intensity catches up with you. Burnout sets in, and suddenly, you find yourself struggling to summon even a fraction of that tiger-like energy you once had. 

So, should we be always try to be the tiger?
