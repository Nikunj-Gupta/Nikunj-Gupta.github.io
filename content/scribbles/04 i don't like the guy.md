I don't like the guy. Do I have reasons? Yeah. Good reasons? Yeah! How many reasons do I need? None. I don't like the guy. It's not about catching him in the act or exposing every lie he's ever told. It's deeper than that. It's the way he speaks with a silver tongue, weaving tales that sound too good to be true. It's the way his eyes shift when you ask him a straightforward question, the way his stories change with every retelling.

It's the way he promises the world and delivers dust. The way he swears he's being honest this time, but you know better. It's the way he smiles when he lies, like he's getting away with something, like he's fooling everyone but himself. It's in the little things, the things you can't quite prove but feel in your bones.

It's the way he denies the undeniable, the way he twists the truth to suit his needs, the way he manipulates reality to paint himself in a better light. It's the constant game of deception, the never-ending cycle of mistrust. Some people might call it harmless exaggeration. Maybe to them, it is. But it's more than that. It's a fundamental breach of integrity, a rift that can't be mended.

And you know what? That's okay. I don't have to believe him, and he doesn't have to change. So I'll keep my distance, and he can keep his lies. We don't have to be friends. We don't even have to pretend. I don't trust the guy. And that's reason enough.
