The concepts of growth and scale can be explored through the lens of personal development and societal progress. Growth, in this sense, refers to qualitative improvements and enhancements in characteristics, knowledge, wisdom, and personal capabilities. It is an inward journey that involves deep self-reflection, learning from experiences, and evolving through challenges. Growth is about becoming more complex and enriched in understanding, values, and virtues.

Scale, on the other hand, suggests a quantitative expansion, involving the ability to replicate or extend influence or impact effectively across larger ideas or to a broader audience. It is concerned with amplification, but not necessarily with the depth or essence of what is being amplified. 

So what would you choose? Growth or scale?
